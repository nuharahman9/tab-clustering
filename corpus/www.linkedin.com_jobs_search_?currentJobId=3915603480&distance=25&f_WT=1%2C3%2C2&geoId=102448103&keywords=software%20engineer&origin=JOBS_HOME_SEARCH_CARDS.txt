About the job
We're Celonis, the global leader in Process Mining technology and one of the world's fastest-growing SaaS firms. We believe there is a massive opportunity to unlock productivity by placing data and intelligence at the core of business processes - and for that, we need you to join us.

The team:

The Knowledge Layer team at Celonis builds the central server that Celonis services consult to read and write each customer’s definitions about their business. This includes the queries used to define their KPIs, how they organize their processes, how they slice their data, and more. Our team is responsible for defining these concepts to meet user requirements, fit the Celonis platform, and keep front-ends operating with joyful speed. The team works in lockstep with Celonis Product Managers and the front-end engineering teams to coordinate user-centric solutions.

The role:

As a Software Engineer on the Knowledge Layer team, you will bring your expertise in server development to our innovative projects and continuously evolving concepts. Due to the Knowledge Layer’s position as a central service, you’ll get to work with globally-distributed engineering teams across the company to coordinate your work. You will have the opportunity to work with cutting-edge cloud technology, stay on top of trends, and drive projects with an ever-increasing degree of independence. This is a unique opportunity for talented engineers to push their boundaries and think big.

The work you’ll do:


Design and implement scalable and performant server endpoints and libraries
Write clean, understandable, and testable code
Provide feedback on the designs and code of peers 
Manage individual project priorities, deadlines, and deliverables
Document development procedures, concepts and knowledge
Build, launch, and maintain features in production
Help define a fun and inclusive engineering culture 


The qualifications you’ll typically need:


Bachelor’s degree or equivalent practical experience
3+ years of experience in server development, e.g. Java, C++, Python
Some experience building RPC endpoints for front-ends and other back-ends
Some experience in frontend development, e.g. Angular TypeScript, TypeScript/JavaScript, HTML5, CSS/SCSS
Strong communication and collaboration skills
Passion and motivation to learn and grow as a software engineered for this role


Visa sponsorship is not offered for this role.

Commitments
Environmental sustainability
We believe that Earth is Our Future. Sustaining our planet isn’t about keeping up with trends, it’s about committing to a better way of doing business. We believe in delivering real change internally, and real value externally. Celonis has committed to setting near and long-term science-based targets in line with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) Net-Zero Standard. Our 2022 Sustainability Report outlines the measures we’re taking to reduce emissions and the investments we’re making in a range of climate solutions to create the most impact. We believe in delivering green value to our customers by leveraging the power of our Execution Management System (EMS). Our product empowers every company to reduce its carbon impact and execute in a sustainable way through the elimination of process inefficiencies. We can change the world - one process at a time.

Social impact
We think companies that can do more, should. We give each of our 3000+ Celonauts three days a year to make a positive change in their communities or on the planet. We call these Celonis Impact Days and they contributed to 50,000 hours of impact in 2022 alone. We also use our resources to amplify the good Celonauts are doing in the world by supporting causes they care about through donation-matching schemes and internal programming. We believe in equal opportunities and the power of education to pursue one's dreams. So, we designed the Aspire program to combat educational inequality by removing financial barriers and turning educational dreams into real opportunities. We also launched our Academic Alliance program in partnership with over a thousand universities to help educate the next generation of process miners. We’re supporting students and teachers globally by providing free access to Celonis technology for learning purposes, and opportunities to earn learning certifications. We believe that together we can really make a difference.

Work-life balance
At Celonis, we want to support Celonauts through their key life stages and milestones. We recognize the demanding work we ask of our employees and want to give Celonauts time to recharge and take care of their loved ones. Our family leave program, offering 24 weeks of paid leave for main carers and 12 weeks for supporting carers, helps new parents to spend time bonding with their baby or adopted child in a way that fits their family circumstances. Celonauts are eligible for this benefit from day 1 of their journey with us. Additionally, we offer a wide range of employee offerings globally to support employee health and wellbeing, including subsidized gym memberships and confidential counseling to support Celonauts through difficult times. Celonis has adopted a hybrid working model allowing Celonauts to work part of their working week at home. We’ve invested in our offices globally to ensure Celonauts have access to comfortable workspaces that promote collaboration and socialization to bring the Celonis culture to life. We aim to provide the resources and support to ensure Celonis is a place where everyone feels valued and can thrive.

Career growth and learning
We live and breathe continuous improvement. It’s a fundamental aspect of what we do, and we extend that to the professional and personal development of our employees. Through our evolving learning experience platform, Celonauts can access skills training for today or learn new skills for a future role. Though Celonauts are the drivers of their careers, we offer mentorship programs, skills development, and consistent training opportunities to foster their growth. Our Internal Mobility Program provides career path options - not just based on what an employee has been doing, but based on what they could do for other teams, functions, or locations. It gives our employees the chance to upskill, scale their impact, become leaders, and even create new departments to fuel their career development and Celonis’ success.

Diversity, equity, and inclusion
We believe that The Best Team Wins. And the best-performing teams are diverse ones. We are committed to building a workplace that truly reflects the diversity of the world we live in and a culture that exemplifies our values. We know we have a long way to go, but we have laid crucial foundations for our global DEI strategy. Our approach to DEI is data-driven and our roadmap is built on precise insights from analytics, as well as key performance indicators and targets to monitor our progress. Our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) support our goals of creating a sense of belonging at Celonis. Many of these communities are sponsored by our executive team and come together to exchange experiences, celebrate cultural events, and support each other's development.
